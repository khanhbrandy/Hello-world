# Hello-world
You sinned by being average. You never stood out. You didn’t study any more than you needed to get by. You did just the minimum of what was asked. You didn’t try to learn new skills. You didn’t try to improve your current skills, because you didn’t have to. No wonder you were the first to be firedand are the last to be re-hired.
